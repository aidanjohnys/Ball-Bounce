# Ball Bounce
Ball Bounce is a simple Python demo created using the University of portsmouths graphix.py library. In this demo, a ball bounces around the screen, changing direction when it hits the edges. 

To run this demo clone the repo.
`git clone https://github.com/aidanjohnys/Ball-Bounce`

And then open up the `src` and run main.py. Make sure to have the graphix.py library in the same directory as the main.py file.
